# pokemom_frontend

My mother has been really into pokemon lately so this project is for her since she has be really excited for shinies.

Search and capture pokemon. Then you can take a look at what a shiny would look like.

Click on pokemon to turn then into shinys and put them into your storage with the pokeballs.
